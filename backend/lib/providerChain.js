/**
 * lib/providerChain.js — resolves each tenant's provider config, enforces
 * a per-provider-key concurrency cap (KeyedSemaphore), and streams a chat
 * completion across a tenant's provider chain with automatic failover to
 * the next provider on a pre-stream failure. Extracted out of server.js's
 * original single-file monolith.
 *
 * Concurrency control caps how many requests are in flight AT ONCE against
 * the SAME provider key. Without this, N simultaneous users across one or
 * many tenants sharing a key can all fire at once, each individually
 * retrying across the fallback chain, and burst straight through the
 * free-tier rate limit together — which looks like "the API stops
 * responding" even though no single request did anything wrong. Extra
 * requests queue briefly instead of firing all at once; if the queue wait
 * itself times out, that provider entry is treated as busy and we move to
 * the next one in the chain.
 *
 * This module owns no tenant/request state beyond the semaphore singleton
 * below, which is intentionally process-local (see the NOTE in the
 * KeyedSemaphore comment: this does NOT become distributed just because
 * REDIS_URL is set — kv.js's simple get/set/list primitives can't express
 * atomic acquire/release. Running multiple instances gives each its own
 * independent concurrency cap, not a shared one — size
 * MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_PROVIDER_KEY with that in mind if you scale out).
